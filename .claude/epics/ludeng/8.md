# Task 8: Frontend Interface Development

## Overview

Implement the complete React-based frontend interface for the ludeng AI batch scene generation system. This includes all user-facing components for upload, configuration, real-time progress tracking, and result management.

## Scope

### Core Components Implementation
- **Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop file upload with preview and validation
- **Configuration Panel**: Smart/manual mode toggle with comprehensive form controls
- **Progress Dashboard**: Real-time task status display with WebSocket integration
- **Result Gallery**: Group-based image preview with download capabilities
- **History Management**: Task history browser with search and filter functionality

### Technical Requirements
- React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Material-UI or equivalent component library for consistent design
- WebSocket client for real-time progress updates

### State Management Schema
```typescript
interface AppState {
  upload: {
    files: File[];
    uploading: boolean;
    uploadProgress: Record<string, number>;
  };
  configuration: {
    mode: 'smart' | 'manual';
    smartConfig: SmartConfigType;
    manualConfig: ManualConfigType;
    presets: ConfigPreset[];
  };
  tasks: {
    current: Task | null;
    history: Task[];
    loading: boolean;
    filters: TaskFilters;
  };
  results: {
    currentResults: ImageResult[];
    downloading: boolean;
    downloadProgress: number;
  };
  websocket: {
    connected: boolean;
    reconnecting: boolean;
    lastMessage: WebSocketMessage | null;
  };
}
```

### WebSocket Integration
- Connect on task start, maintain persistent connection
- Handle connection drops with exponential backoff retry
- Message types: progress_update, task_complete, error, queue_position
- Graceful degradation with polling fallback
- Connection status indicator in UI

### Form Validation Rules
- Required fields validation with custom error messages
- File type and size validation
- Numeric range validation for sliders and inputs
- Custom validation for prompt text (length, content)
- Cross-field validation for dependent parameters
- Async validation for unique task names

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Lazy loading for heavy components (gallery, history)
- Virtual scrolling for large image lists
- Image thumbnail lazy loading with intersection observer
- Component memoization for expensive renders
- Debounced search and filter inputs
- Service worker for offline capability (optional)

### Bundle Size Management
- Code splitting by route and feature
- Tree shaking for unused library code
- Dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Asset optimization (images, fonts)
- Bundle analysis and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and prop handling
- Hook functionality and state updates
- Utility functions and form validation
- API service mocking and error scenarios
- WebSocket connection handling

### Integration Tests
- File upload flow end-to-end
- Configuration form submission
- Progress tracking accuracy
- Result gallery interactions
- History management operations

### E2E Tests (using Playwright/Cypress)
- Complete user workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design verification
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility compliance

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Libraries
- React 18+, TypeScript 4.9+
- State management: Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- UI framework: Material-UI v5 or Ant Design
- Form handling: react-hook-form
- HTTP client: axios or fetch wrapper
- WebSocket: socket.io-client or native WebSocket
- File handling: react-dropzone
- Image display: react-image-gallery or custom lightbox

### Development Tools
- Vite or Create React App for build tooling
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Jest + Testing Library for unit tests
- Storybook for component development (optional)

### Backend Dependencies
- Upload API endpoints must be ready
- WebSocket server implementation required
- Task management APIs for history and control
- File serving capabilities for downloads

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket reliability**: Implement polling fallback
- **Large file uploads**: Add chunked upload with resume
- **Memory leaks**: Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- **Browser compatibility**: Polyfills and progressive enhancement

### UX Risks
- **Complex configuration**: Provide guided tour and presets
- **Long wait times**: Clear progress indication and ETA
- **Error handling**: User-friendly messages with actionable steps
- **Mobile compatibility**: Responsive design testing
