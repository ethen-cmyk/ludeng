   ```
   /storage/
   ├── uploads/
   │   ├── 2025/
   │   │   ├── 09/
   │   │   │   ├── 15/
   │   │   │   │   ├── {uuid}.jpg
   │   │   │   │   └── variants/
   │   │   │   │       ├── thumb_{uuid}.jpg
   │   │   │   │       └── preview_{uuid}.jpg
   ```

2. **Metadata Storage**
   - Database schema for file records
   - EXIF data preservation
   - Search indexing for metadata fields
   - Version tracking for file updates

### Phase 4: Download and Packaging (2 hours)
1. **Download Service**
   ```javascript
   class DownloadService {
     async generateDownloadURL(fileId, options) {}
     async createZipPackage(fileIds, options) {}
     async trackDownload(fileId, userId) {}
     async cleanupExpiredURLs() {}
   }
   ```
