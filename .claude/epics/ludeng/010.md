# Deploy new version
git pull origin main
npm ci --production
npm run build

# Database migrations
npm run migrate:prod

# Restart services
sudo systemctl start ludeng-backend
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# Health check
sleep 10
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || {
    echo "Health check failed, rolling back..."
    sudo systemctl stop ludeng-backend

## Risk Mitigation

### Deployment Risks
- **Downtime during deployment**: Blue-green deployment strategy or rolling updates
- **Configuration errors**: Automated configuration validation and testing
- **Database migration failures**: Backup before migration, rollback procedures
- **SSL certificate expiration**: Automated renewal with monitoring

### Security Risks
- **Unauthorized access**: Strong authentication, VPN access, regular security audits
- **Data breaches**: Encryption at rest and in transit, regular security updates
- **DDoS attacks**: Rate limiting, CDN protection, monitoring and alerting
- **API key exposure**: Secure secret management, regular key rotation

### Performance Risks
- **Resource exhaustion**: Monitoring and alerting, auto-scaling (if supported)
- **Database performance**: Query optimization, connection pooling, caching
- **File storage limitations**: Cleanup automation, monitoring, backup strategies
- **External API limits**: Rate limiting, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms

### Operational Risks
- **Single point of failure**: High availability setup, backup procedures
- **Knowledge gaps**: Comprehensive documentation, team training
- **Backup failures**: Regular backup testing, multiple backup strategies
- **Monitoring gaps**: Comprehensive monitoring coverage, regular reviews
