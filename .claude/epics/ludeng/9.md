# Task 9: Differentiation Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

Implement the core differentiation algorithm that calculates 4-dimension differences between image generation combinations and provides intelligent deduplication using combination key hashing and visual similarity detection.

## Description

This task focuses on developing the heart of the ludeng system - the algorithm that ensures generated images are sufficiently different from each other and from historical results. The implementation includes sophisticated similarity detection using perceptual hashing and structural similarity metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

  - Location characteristics (urban, suburban, rural, industrial)
  - Camera angle/perspective (ground level, elevated, aerial, close-up)
- [ ] Create Euclidean distance calculation for combination differences
- [ ] Implement minimum difference threshold validation (configurable, default: 2.5)

### Combination Key Management
- [ ] Create combination key hashing algorithm for efficient deduplication
- [ ] Implement hash-based lookup for existing combinations
- [ ] Support both MD5 and SHA-256 hashing options
- [ ] Create combination key regeneration for parameter changes

### Visual Similarity Detection
- [ ] Implement perceptual hashing (pHash) for generated images
- [ ] Integrate SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) calculation
- [ ] Create visual similarity scoring with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Implement image fingerprinting for fast comparison

### Smart Retry Mechanism
- [ ] Implement intelligent retry logic for failed combinations
- [ ] Create fallback parameter selection when combinations are too similar
- [ ] Implement adaptive parameter adjustment based on failure patterns
- [ ] Add maximum retry limit protection (default: 3 attempts per combination)

### Database Integration
- [ ] Create database models for combination history
- [ ] Implement efficient queries for similarity lookups
- [ ] Add database indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Create cleanup routines for old combination data

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for batch calculations
- [ ] Create caching layer for frequently accessed combinations
- [ ] Optimize algorithm performance for <1 second calculation time
- [ ] Add memory usage optimization for large datasets

## Technical Requirements

### Algorithm Specifications
- **Distance Calculation**: Use weighted Euclidean distance with configurable dimension weights
- **Hash Algorithm**: Support both MD5 (fast) and SHA-256 (secure) for combination keys
- **Similarity Thresholds**: 
  - Combination difference minimum: 2.5
  - Visual similarity maximum: 0.8 (SSIM)
  - Perceptual hash distance minimum: 10
- **Performance**: <1 second for single combination analysis, <5 seconds for batch of 8

### Dependencies
- **Database**: Requires task 3 (Database Schema and Models) to be completed
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV or Sharp library for visual analysis
- **Hashing**: Crypto library for combination key generation

### Data Structures
```javascript
// Combination representation
